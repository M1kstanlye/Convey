<p> America leads the world in food waste. According to <a href=“https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/american-food-waste/491513/”>The Atlantic</a>,
 “roughly 50% of all produce in the United States is thrown away—some 60 million tons (or $160 billion) worth of produce annually, an amount constituting “one third
 of all food stuff.” Wasted food is also the single biggest occupant in American landfills, the Environmental Protection Agency has found.” This is beyond outstanding,
 when compared to the rest of the world.</p>

 <p> As a country, when we allow large amount fo food to be wasted, in such a glutinous/selfish way, we only show the world how ignorant we can be.
     Instead of allowing us to do so, we should collectivly veiw the waste as time and money. Both the consumer and producer are getting the shortest end of the stick.
     On top of that solving world hunger would take lest time to get to.</p>
 <p> According to the Food and Agriculture organization of America, global quantitative food losses and waste per year are roughly:</p>

   <div id="FAOinfo">
        <ol>
            <li>30% for cereals</li>
            <li>40-50% for root crops, fruits and vegetables</li>
            <li>20% for oil seeds, meat and dairy</li>
            <li>plus 35% for fish</li>
            </ol>
    </div>

<p>This is show's how frivalous the U.s. consumers can get. For more infromation click the link <a href="http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/">FAO</a></p>

<P>Here’s why are trying to team up with Feeding Food Forward, grocery stores, Restaurant, and even neighborhood’s:</p>

<p>Being apart of Generation Z meant we grew up with the evolution of technology. We also, sadly, grew up with a lot of complaining about the issues of the world.
    I'm pretty sure we, at somepoint got sick of it all. A lot of kids our age, which is around 4-24 as of 2019, are actually doing someting. Doing more to change
    that We've seen in out life time at least. We want to help push, not only Northern America, but the rest of the world towards a greeneer and over all healthier future.</p>

<p>Everyone can help make this change. You don't even have to spend money or volunteer. just give up the food you know for sure you wont eat. If you'd like to volunteer</p>

 <P>I understand if some just do not care But! What if you didn’t do it for other people? Or the earth? Or America? What if you did it for yourself? This way you
     wouldn’t be wasting your money on food you thought you’d eat but didn’t. You don’t have to say you live in a country that wastes more food than anything else.
     That you live in a country that is so selfish you have to walk through the streets with food. If your still sceptical I dare you to give it a try. Go ahead
     and look at what you'd be doing if you <a href= "https://github.com/MUIGoku16/Convery-Subcription.git">joined the cause</a>.I dare you! with teh least amount
     of pressure at least.<a href= "https://github.com/TekkenForceX/Convey.git">No pressure.</a></p>
