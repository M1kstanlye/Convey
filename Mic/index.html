<div id= "PtSansNarrow">
        <P>Convey is a website/app dedicated to ending the food waste epidemic in America. Here we provide a donation funded service which
        allows people to help reduce their own and america's over all food waste.</p>

        <P>Our services provide people with the ability to donate
        wasted food track to get rid of food that is or going bad. Wasted food is the #1 coupent of our landfills. This shouldn't be the
        case. In a world where America could literally feed every mouth in its own population, but still has loads of people on the street
        starving is very sad and can be prevented.</P>

        <h3><u>Our Plan?</u></h3>

<div id= "PtSansNarrow">
        <P>As we are just begining the first thing we do is figure out what to do now. So, what is that next step? To work with <a href="https://www.ffwd.org/blog/tech-nonprofits/feeding-forward-solving-hunger-ending-food-waste/">Feed It Forward</a>
             a nonprofit organization started by a man named Jagger Gordon. He and I had just about the same Idea. what makes his different he went straight to the point and executed it. We, on the other hand, not only haven’t executed our plans, we
             also didn’t stick to one and only idea. We branched out ideas to see how far we could go. How many more people could we help? Teaming up with Mr. Grodon would allow Convey to target other opertunities.
